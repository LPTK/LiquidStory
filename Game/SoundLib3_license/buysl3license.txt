::Limitations
All licenses are per product branch. If you buy a license for version 3.x, it won't cover the
upgrade to version 4.x. However, cost reduced upgrades will be offered in such cases.

A license applies to the platform (Windows, Mac, etc) you paid for. However, there will be a 
discount if you buy a license for an additional platform.

You are free to use SoundLib3 for testing purposes until your product is ready for the market. 
Reselling your license is not allowed. Licensing your product which uses SoundLib to others is not 
allowed, your licensees need to have their own SoundLib license (contact us if you have a 
problem with this; there may be other solutions).

::Source code
It is possible to obtain the SoundLib source code for your own adaptions. Source code is only
given away under NDA and not for free. Contact us for further details.
